# MPRI-SE-Click-Run

Do you want to test your skills in an old school 2D run and jump game ?
Well you're at the right place !

## Running

We use Python 3 to run our game.
If you don't have it already installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Then after you checked all the dependencies you can run the game by typing the
following command in `/etc` :
```
python3 main.py
```
Enjoy !

## Dependencies

First we recommend to use `pip3` in order to install the different python3 packages.

If you're running on Debian (Wheezy and newer) or Ubuntu (Trusty Tahr and newer)
you can install pip3 by typing the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
If you're running on CentOS 7 :
```
# First command requires you to have enabled EPEL for CentOS7
sudo yum install python34-setuptools
sudo easy_install pip
```

Then here is the list of the packages we use and how to install them :
1. Numpy :
```
pip3 install numpy
```
2. Pygame:
```
pip3 install pygame
```
